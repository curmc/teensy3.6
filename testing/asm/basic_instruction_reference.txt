MOV
 - cannot access memory (RAM)
 - cannot move more than 8 bits
 - cannot mov to higher register (r8 - r13)

  MOV r0, #150
  MOV r1, r2

LDR
  - Loads register with 32 bit constant or another register

  LDR r0,=0xFFFF
  LDR r1,[r2] ; loads r1 with the value pointed to by r2
  LDR r1, r2  ; loads r1 with the value inside r2

STR
  - Stores register value into memory (RAM)
  - Different than others: source, destination not destination, source

  STR r0, [r1] ; stores value of r0 into r1 
  STR r0, r1   ; stores value of r0 into address of r1

B 
  - Branch to location
  B loop ; jumps to loop

BL 
  - Branch to subroutine

  BL turn_on ; branches to subroutine turn_on - expects turn_on to return:

BX LR
  - Return from subroutine call

  turn_on:
    MOV   r2,#0x01
    BX    LR

NOP
  - no opperation
